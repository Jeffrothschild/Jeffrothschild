# About Me

Hi, I'm a sports nutritionist finishing up my PhD in exercise physiology, applying data science in my work with elite athletes. I'm on here to learn and share code!

# Research

My research focuses on the intersection between nutrition, training load, and training adaptations. [Click here](http://jeff-rothschild.netlify.app) to see some of my research. Where appropriate, code has been shared on my github page.

# Apps

As an extension of some of my research, I've built a few Shiny apps for calculating [fat oxidation](https://rothschild.shinyapps.io/RER_dashboard/), [molecular signaling](https://rothschild.shinyapps.io/AMPK_dashboard/), and [within-day energy balance](https://rothschild.shinyapps.io/Energy-balance/).
